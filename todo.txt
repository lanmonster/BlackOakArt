TODO:

1. Redesign the db — difficult. will probably take 2-3 days.
	- schema called “have”, table for each task (prep, throw, debat, trim, assemble, polish, stamps, handles
	- schema called “main” , needs workshopping, table for POs (include progress in PO table??)
2. Calculate need for each task — difficult. will probably take 1-2 days.
3. Refactor the end-of-day entry — trivial. will probably take > ~5 hrs. 
	- needs to look like the todo page, but with blank spots to enter info for each task/po
